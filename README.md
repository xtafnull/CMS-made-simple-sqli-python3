 CMS Made Simple &lt; 2.2.10 - SQL Injection (rewritten for python3),  CVE-2019-9053

 I found it problematic to run this exploit on kali linux, since python2 doesn't have termcolor, so with very few brackets I made it working with python3.

 I tested it against a cms vulnerable machine on https://tryhackme.com
 It is working as intended
